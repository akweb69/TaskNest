# Task Management Application - Frontend

## Overview

##### This is the frontend part of the Task Management Application, where users can manage tasks through a clean and minimalistic user interface. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, reorder, and drag-and-drop tasks across three categories: To-Do, In Progress, and Done. The frontend is built with **React** and is fully responsive, supporting both desktop and mobile users. It communicates with the backend via API endpoints to persist data.

## Live Link

## Features

- **Authentication**: Users can sign in using **Google** through Firebase Authentication.
- **Task Management**: Users can:
  - Add new tasks with a title, description, and category.
  - Edit task details (title, description, and category).
  - Delete tasks.
  - Reorder tasks within and across categories.
  - Drag and drop tasks between categories (To-Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Responsiveness**: The app is fully responsive and provides a smooth drag-and-drop experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-Time Sync**: The app updates tasks in real-time, ensuring the latest changes are immediately reflected across the UI.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building interactive UI components.
- **Firebase Authentication**: For handling user sign-in with Google.
- **Vite.js**: Fast and modern build tool for bundling the frontend.
- **react-beautiful-dnd**: Drag-and-drop library used to reorder tasks and move them between categories.
